Write a program named Distributed that reads four integers and uses them to demonstrate the distributive property as follows:

Sample Interactive Run 1:

    Please enter 4 integers:
    3 4 5 6
    ( 3 + 4 ) X ( 5 + 6 ) == 7 X 11 == 77
    3X5 + 3X6 + 4X5 + 4X6  == 15 + 18 + 20 + 24 == 77
Sample Interactive Run 2:

    Please enter 4 integers:
    2 4 10 20
    ( 2 + 4 ) X ( 10 + 20 ) == 6 X 30 == 180
    2X10 + 2X20 + 4X10 + 4X20  == 20 + 40 + 40 + 80 == 180
NOTE: in the two sample interactive runs above, the program's prompt and output are in bold; the user's data entry is in italics.

NOTE: Additional Requirement: Do NOT use any assignment operators here.
